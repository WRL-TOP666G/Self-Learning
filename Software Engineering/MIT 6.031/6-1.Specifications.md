# Specifications
Good for the client of a module becuase they help make the module easier to understand.

## Specification structure
- a precondition: an obligation on the client over the state in which the method is invoked.
- a postcondition: an obligation on the implementer of the method.

## Spec
``` Java
static boolean isPalindrome(String word)
    requires: word contains only alphanumeric characters
     effects: returns true if and only if word is a palindrome
```

## Specification structure
- Precondition: requires
- Postcondition: effects


## Specifications in Java
``` Java
static int find(int[] arr, int val)
  requires: val occurs exactly once in arr
  effects:  returns index i such that arr[i] = val
```

``` Java
/**
 * Find a value in an array.
 * @param arr array to search, requires that val occurs exactly once
 *            in arr
 * @param val value to search for
 * @return index i such that arr[i] = val
 */
static int find(int[] arr, int val)
``` 

## Javadoc
``` Java
/**
 * Check if a word is a palindrome.
 * A palindrome is a sequence of characters
 * that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 * @param word word to check, must contain only alphanumeric characters
 * @return true if and only if word is a palindrome
 */
```


## Do not allow null references
- Primitive cannot be `null`.
``` Java 
int size = null;     // illegal
double depth = null; // illegal
```

- `null` can assign to any non-primitive variable.
``` Java 
String name = null;   
int[] points = null; 

name.length(); // throw NullPointerException
points.length; // throw NullPointerException
```

## Include emptiness
- Java
    - `null` reference is not a valid string, or list, or map, or any other object.
    - empty stirng "" is a valid `String` value, empty list `List.of()` is a valid list value. 

empty values are always allowed as parameter or return values
